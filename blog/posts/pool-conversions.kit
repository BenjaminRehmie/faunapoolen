<h2>Do you have a neglected and lifeless pool that is dying to be converted? </h2>
<p>In this blog, we explore the benefits, process, and inspiring real-world examples of turning traditional pools into natural ecosystems, with a spotlight on projects completed by Aquascape Certified Artist Contractors — a global network of elite water feature professionals trained to bring these natural transformations to life.</p>

<h2>Why Convert a Traditional Pool?</h2>
<p>Traditional swimming pools require constant maintenance, chemical treatments, and energy-intensive filtration systems. Homeowners often face challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>High electricity and water usage.</li>
    <li>Exposure to a long list of chemicals that are harsh on eyes and skin.</li>
    <li>Unsightly pool covers during off-season.</li>
    <li>Disconnection from surrounding nature.</li>
</ul>

<p>A natural swim pond, on the other hand, offers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chemical-free water filtered by plants and beneficial bacteria.</li>
    <li>Energy efficiency through gravity-fed circulation systems.</li>
    <li>Enhanced biodiversity as the pond becomes a habitat for frogs, dragonflies, and birds.</li>
    <li>All-season beauty that transforms the backyard into a living landscape.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a nature pool?</h2>
<p>A Natural Swim Pond, also known as an ecosystem pond, is designed to work with nature rather than against it. Unlike traditional swimming pools that rely heavily on chemicals, these systems operate as a closed-loop environment where water is filtered through natural biological processes. The pond is typically divided into two main zones: a deeper swimming area dedicated to recreation, and a shallower regeneration zone planted with aquatic vegetation that filters and oxygenates the water.</p>
<p>In addition to these zones, supporting systems help maintain clarity and balance. Skimmers and biological filtration units remove debris and support beneficial bacteria, while gravel beds provide surface area for microbial life to thrive. Aeration systems ensure adequate oxygen levels throughout the pond. Together, these elements create a self-sustaining ecosystem that functions much like a natural lake or stream, keeping the water clean and clear throughout the year.</p>

<h2>The Conversion Process: Step-by-Step</h2>
        <p>Below is an overview of what a typical project may include.</p>

        <h3>Assessment & Planning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaluate the existing pool structure (concrete, and plumbing)</li>
            <li>Design a new layout including regeneration zones and stream additions</li>
            <li>Consider orientation, sunlight exposure, and surrounding landscape</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Demolition or Reshaping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Drain the pool and remove unnecessary fittings</li>
            <li>Break up hard angles or re-contour the floor for a more natural appearance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filtration Installation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Excavate the areas allocated for the intake bay, streams and wetland filter</li>
            <li>Install Aquascape pumps and EcoBlox if pondless elements are desired</li>
            <li>Add natural stone to naturalize the swimming pools appearance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Regeneration Zone & Planting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Line the zone with gravel</li>
            <li>Introduce aquatic plants such as water lilies, reeds, and submerged oxygenators</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filling & Cycling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill the pond with water</li>
            <li>Allow the ecosystem to stabilize (may take around 2 weeks depending on the size)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add marginals, lighting, and social areas such as fire pits or patios</li>
            <li>Introduce fish, if desired</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Real-World Transformations: Aquascape Certified Contractor Highlights</h2>
<p>Atlantis Water Gardens (New Jersey, USA)</p>
<ul>
    <p>Greg Wittstock, the founder of Aquascape, frequently showcases work from top Certified Contractors like Atlantis Water Gardens. One of their notable projects involved a complete conversion of a rectangular chlorine pool into a kidney-shaped ecosystem pond with waterfalls and a large regeneration zone. This project highlighted the flexibility of pool shapes and how structural limitations can be reimagined with creative vision.<p/>
    <p>"We took a pool that was falling apart and turned it into a paradise. The family now swims with koi, frogs, and turtles — and they don’t miss chlorine one bit,” said Atlantis co-founder, Jack Chernick.<p/>
</ul>

<p>Living Ponds (Oregon, USA)</p>
<ul>
    <p>Living Ponds converted an outdated backyard pool into a multi-tiered ecosystem complete with stream beds and wetland filtration. By reusing much of the original plumbing and modifying the concrete shell, they saved costs and minimized waste.<p/>
    <p>“We believe in building with nature, not against it. This transformation created an educational habitat for the homeowners’ children,” noted the project manager.<p/>
</ul>

<p>Premier Aquascapes (Indiana, USA)</p>
<ul>
    <p>Premier Aquascapes completed a large-scale pool conversion for a rural estate. The project incorporated rainwater harvesting features and a waterfall-fed swimming area. They used Aquascape’s Signature Series components to ensure reliability and longevity.<p/>
    <p>“Our goal was to create a recreational area that felt like a mountain spring. We used native plants to ensure the pond would thrive with minimal maintenance.”<p/>
</ul>

<p>These examples reflect the passion and innovation that Aquascape Certified Contractors bring to every project, blending ecological knowledge with artistry.</p>

<h2>Environmental benefits</h2>
<p>Switching from a traditional pool to a natural ecosystem pond has wide-reaching benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Water Conservation: Less evaporation, no draining for chemical balancing.</li>
    <li>Carbon Footprint Reduction: Minimal energy use compared to electric filters and heaters.</li>
    <li>Pollinator Support: Attracts bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects.</li>
    <li>Biodiversity: A habitat for amphibians, birds, and aquatic life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What About Maintenance?</h2>
<p>Many assume that natural ponds require more upkeep — but when designed properly, they’re often easier to manage than traditional pools. Faunapoolen and other Certified Contractors offer seasonal maintenance plans including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Debris removal</li>
    <li>Plant trimming and seasonal cutbacks</li>
    <li>Faunapoolen offer a monthly, bi-monthly or annual maintance package.</li>
</ul>

<p>No more pH tests or chlorine tablets — just simple, nature-friendly care.</p>
